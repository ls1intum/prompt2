            Our goal is to create a comprehensive system that tracks each student's entire participation history,
            including
            applications and course performances. This system will streamline application assessments and provide
            instructors
            with a comprehensive view of each student's academic journey, facilitating more informed
            decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, we plan to implement a global recommendation system that allows instructors to recommend
            students
            for other courses based on their performance history. This system will also enable instructors to add
            context to
            their recommendations, such as specific skill sets or areas of expertise.

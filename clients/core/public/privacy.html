                regulations, in particular the Bavarian Data Protection (BayDSG), the Telemedia Act
                (TMG) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Below, we inform you about
                the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data.

                The web servers of the AET are operated by the AET itself, based in Boltzmannstr. 3,
                85748 Garching b. Munich. Every time our website is accessed, the web server
                temporarily processes the following information in log files:
              </p>
              <ul className='list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2'>
                <li>IP address of the requesting computer</li>

              </ul>
              <p className='mt-4'>
                The processing of the data in this log file takes place as follows:

              <ul className='list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2'>
                <li>
                  The log entries are continuously updated automatically evaluated in order to be able
                  to detect attacks on the web server and react accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In individual cases, i.e. in the case of reported disruptions, errors and security
                  incidents, a manual analysis is carried out.

                  The IP addresses contained in the log entries are not merged with other databases by
                  AET, so that no conclusions can be drawn about individual persons.

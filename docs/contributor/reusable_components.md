# Reusable UI Components

The shared library provides a range of reusable UI components you can easily incorporate into your code.

## ManagementPageHeader

The `ManagementPageHeader` component is a simple but essential part of the user interface. It is used to render a prominent page title or header for management-related pages, making it clear what the purpose of the page is. This component provides a clean, consistent look for headers across different pages in the application.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Title**: The component allows any content to be passed as a child, enabling flexibility to display different titles or headings as needed.
- **Styling**: The header is styled with a large font size (`text-4xl`), bold font (`font-bold`), and a margin at the bottom (`mb-6`), ensuring it stands out on the page.

### Usage

- **Props**:
  - `children`: The content (typically a title or header text) to be displayed inside the `h1` element. This can be a string, a component, or any other valid React node.

The `ManagementPageHeader` component helps standardize page headers across your application and ensures they are easily readable and visually appealing.

(errorpage)=

## ErrorPage

The `ErrorPage` component is designed to handle and display error messages in a user-friendly manner. It provides an alert box with a title, description, and a customizable message to inform users of issues such as network failures or server errors. Additionally, it offers options to retry the action that caused the error or log out of the application.

### Key Features

- **Title & Description**: The component allows customization of the error title and description. By default, it displays a generic "Error" message with a description explaining the issue.
- **Message**: Displays a detailed error message that can be customized. The default message informs users of potential network issues and suggests retrying or waiting.
- **Retry Button**: If the `onRetry` function is provided, a retry button is displayed, allowing the user to attempt the action again.
- **Logout Button**: If the `onLogout` function is provided, a logout button is shown, allowing users to log out of the application if needed.

### Usage

- **Props**:
  - `title` (optional): The title of the error message (defaults to "Error").
  - `description` (optional): A short description of the error (defaults to "An error occurred").
  - `message` (optional): A detailed message explaining the error (defaults to a generic message).
  - `onRetry` (optional): A function that is called when the retry button is clicked.
  - `onLogout` (optional): A function that is called when the logout button is clicked.

This component ensures that errors are presented in a clear and accessible manner, with the flexibility to add custom actions (such as retrying or logging out) based on the specific needs of the application.

## CoursePhaseMailing

The `CoursePhaseMailing` component is used to manage the mailing functionality within a specific course phase.
To integrate the `CoursePhaseMailing` component and set up a Mailing page correctly, follow these steps:

### 1. Import Necessary Components

Start by importing the essential components required for the page, including:

1. **UI Components**:

   - [`ManagementPageHeader`](#managementpageheader): A header component for management pages.
   - [`ErrorPage`](#errorpage): A component to display error messages with retry options.

2. **Routing Utilities**:

   - `useParams` (from React Router): Retrieves the `phaseId` from the URL.

3. **Data Fetching Tools**:

   - `useQuery` (from `@tanstack/react-query`): Handles data fetching and caching.

4. **API Query Function**:
   - `getCoursePhase`: Fetches course phase details using the `phaseId`. This function is part of the shared library and returns a `CoursePhaseWithMetaData` interface, defined in `@tumaet/prompt-shared-state`.

### 2. Retrieve Course Phase Data

- Extract the `phaseId` using `useParams`.
- Use `useQuery` to fetch the relevant course phase data from the core.
- Ensure the `queryFn` correctly calls `getCoursePhase` with the `phaseId`.

### 3. Handle Loading and Errors

- Display a loading indicator (e.g. `Loader2`) while the data is being fetched.
- Show an error page (`ErrorPage`) with a retry option if the request fails.

### 4. Render the Mailing Page

- Use `ManagementPageHeader` for the page title.
- Pass the retrieved `coursePhase` data into the `CoursePhaseMailing` component.

### 5. Ensure Proper Routing

- Register the `MailingPage` component in the application's **routes** and **sidebar** configuration to make it accessible for the appropriate course phase.

### 6. Ensure Styling

To ensure proper styling for the `CoursePhaseMailing` component, you need to include the `index.css` file from the `minimal-tiptap` styles directory in the Webpack configuration (`webpack.config.ts` the component where the Mailing Page should be added).

#### Steps to Modify Webpack Configuration

1. Locate the CSS loader configuration within the `module.rules` section of your Webpack configuration file.
2. Find the existing `include` array for the CSS loader. It should look something like this:

    ```javascript
    {
      test: /\.css$/i,
      include: [
         path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
         path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared_library/src'),
      ],
      use: [
         'style-loader',
         'css-loader',
         'postcss-loader',
      ],
    },
    ```

3. Add the following line to the `include` array:

    ```javascript
    path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared_library/components/minimal-tiptap/styles/index.css'),
    ```

4. The updated configuration should look like this:

    ```javascript
    {
      test: /\.css$/i,
      include: [
         path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
         path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared_library/src'),
         path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared_library/components/minimal-tiptap/styles/index.css'),
      ],
      use: [
         'style-loader',
         'css-loader',
         'postcss-loader',
      ],
    },
    ```

#### Why This Change Is Necessary

1. **Ensures Styles from `minimal-tiptap` are Included**:
    - Without this change, Webpack may not process the CSS file inside `minimal-tiptap/styles`, leading to missing styles in the UI.

2. **Explicitly Includes the Required CSS File**:
    - The `include` option specifies which directories or files Webpack should process with the CSS loaders. Since `index.css` is outside the default `src` and `shared_library/src` paths, it must be explicitly included.

3. **Fixes Potential Styling Issues in the `CoursePhaseMailing` Component**:
    - If this component relies on `minimal-tiptap`, its styles will not be applied unless Webpack is configured to process them.

By making this change, you ensure that the `minimal-tiptap` styles are correctly loaded, preventing broken or missing UI elements in your application.

Following these steps ensures a well-structured Mailing page with smooth data handling and a good user experience.

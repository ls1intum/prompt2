# üìã Application Course Phase

üé• **Video Tutorial**: [Watch here](https://live.rbg.tum.de/w/artemisintro/60491)

The **Application Phase** enables instructors to create application forms for students and manage their submissions. Students can apply to a course by answering a customizable set of questions defined by the instructor.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Application Phase

To configure the application phase, follow these steps:

### 1. Add an Application Phase

Use the Course Configurator to add an **Application Phase** to your course structure.

### 2. Open the Configuration

In the course sidebar, select the newly added application phase, then click on: `Configure Course Phase`

![Application Phase Configuration](./images/application_1.png)

This opens a dialog for setting the phase's behavior and schedule.

### 3. Configure General Application Settings

You must define a start and end date. These timestamps use the **system time (Europe/Berlin)**. If students access the application from other time zones, a note will be shown to clarify that deadlines refer to the German time zone.

You can also configure the following options:

| Option                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enforce Student Login**   | Requires students with a university login and matriculation number to log in via Keycloak. Recommended in most cases. Disable only for self-hosted, non-university setups. |
| **Allow External Students** | Allows students without university credentials (e.g., exchange students) to submit applications.                                                                           |
| **Auto Accept Application** | Automatically accepts every application. Use this only when the application serves as a simple registration form.                                                          |

## üß© Creating Application Questions

Once you've configured the start and end time, you can begin adding application questions. Click **Add Question** and choose one of the following types:

* Text Question
* Multi-Select Question
* Checkbox Question

You can **reorder questions** via drag-and-drop.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Assessment Phase

To configure the assessment phase, follow these steps:

### 1. Add an Assessment Phase

Use the Course Configurator to add an **Assessment Phase** to your course structure. Connect the participants and team data (if you want to use peer or tutor evaluations).

### 2. Open the Configuration

In the course sidebar, select the newly added assessment phase, then click on: `Settings` (gear icon).

This opens a dialog for setting the phase's behavior and schedule.

### 3. Configure Assessment Phase Settings

You must define the following core settings:

| Setting                 | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assessment Template** | Select which assessment template to use (defines the competency structure) |
| **Start Date**          | When the assessment phase begins (using the timeframe selector)            |
| **Deadline**            | When the assessment phase ends (using the timeframe selector)              |

#### Visibility Settings

Control when students can see their assessment results:

| Setting                       | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Grade Suggestions Visible** | When enabled, students can view their grade suggestions after the deadline has passed             |
| **Action Items Visible**      | When enabled, students can see their action items (feedback points) after the deadline has passed |

> üí° **Note**: Both visibility settings only take effect **after the assessment deadline**. Before the deadline, grade suggestions and action items are never visible to students, regardless of these settings. This ensures students cannot see preliminary results during the active assessment phase.

**Use Cases:**

- **Grade Suggestions**: Enable this when you want students to see their overall performance score
- **Action Items**: Enable this to share specific feedback points and improvement suggestions with students
- **Both Disabled**: Use when you want to keep all assessment results private (e.g., for administrative purposes only)

#### Optional Evaluation Types

You can enable additional evaluation methods

| Evaluation Type      | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Self Evaluation**  | Students evaluate themselves using a separate competency template  |
| **Peer Evaluation**  | Students evaluate their peers using a separate competency template |
| **Tutor Evaluation** | Students evaluate tutors using a separate competency template      |

Each evaluation type has its own:

- **Template**: Which competencies to evaluate
- **Start Date**: When this evaluation becomes available
- **Deadline**: When this evaluation closes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: All timestamps use **system time (Europe/Berlin) with deadlines ending at 23:59**.

## üèóÔ∏è Creating and Editing Assessment Schemas

Assessment schemas define the structure of your evaluation through **Assessment Templates**.

### Understanding the Hierarchy

The assessment system uses a three-level hierarchy:

```text
Assessment Template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Categories (weighted groups)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Competency 1 (individual skills with weights)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Competency 2
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Creating a New Assessment Template

1. **Navigate to Settings**: In your assessment phase, go to the Settings page
2. **Create Template**: Click "Create New Template" in the template selector
3. **Fill Template Details**:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for your template
   - **Description**: Brief explanation of the template's purpose

### Building the Competency Structure

Once your template is created, you need to build the competency structure:

#### Adding Categories

Categories are weighted groups of related competencies:

1. Click **"Add Category"**
2. Fill in the category details:
   - **Name**: Category title (e.g., "Technical Skills")
   - **Short Name**: Abbreviated version
   - **Description**: Brief explanation
   - **Weight**: Numerical weight for final score calculation
3. Click **"Create"**

#### Adding Competencies

Competencies are individual skills within categories:

1. Click **"Add Competency"** within a category
2. Complete the competency form:
   - **Name**: Competency title (e.g., "Programming Ability")
   - **Short Name**: Abbreviated version
   - **Weight**: Numerical weight within the category
   - **Description**: Brief explanation
   - **Score Level Descriptions**: Define what each level means:
     - **Very Bad**: Description for lowest performance
     - **Bad**: Description for below-average performance
     - **Ok**: Description for average performance
     - **Good**: Description for above-average performance
     - **Very Good**: Description for excellent performance

### Editing Existing Templates

- **Edit Categories**: Click the edit icon next to any category
- **Edit Competencies**: Click the edit icon next to any competency
- **Delete Items**: Click the trash icon (‚ö†Ô∏è this cannot be undone)

## üó∫Ô∏è Setting Up the Competency Map

The competency map allows you to link competencies from your self and peer evaluation templates to your assessment, so they show up in the assessment view.

### Understanding Competency Mapping

When you have self or peer evaluation enabled, you can map evaluation competencies to the main assessment:

- **Self Evaluation ‚Üí Assessment**: Link self evaluation competencies to the main assessment competencies
- **Peer Evaluation ‚Üí Assessment**: Link peer evaluation competencies to the main assessment competencies

This enables them to show up in the main assessment view to be taken into account in the main assessment.

### Creating Mappings

1. **Navigate to Settings**: Go to the Settings page in your assessment phase
2. **Find Competency**: Locate the competency you want to map to
3. **Select Mapping**: In the assessment mapping section:
   - Choose the source competency from the self or peer evaluation dropdown
   - Select "No mapping" to remove an existing mapping
4. **Save Changes**: Mappings are saved automatically

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: You can map only one self and one peer competency to each assessment competency.

## üìà How Average Scores Are Calculated

The assessment system uses a sophisticated weighted scoring algorithm to compute final scores.

### Score Level Conversion

Each score level is converted to a numerical value:

| Score Level | Numerical Value |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Very Good   | 1.0             |
| Good        | 2.0             |
| Ok          | 3.0             |
| Bad         | 4.0             |
| Very Bad    | 5.0             |

### Calculation Process

The `getWeightedScoreLevel` function computes the final score through these steps:

#### 1. **Competency-Level Calculation**

For each competency with scores:

```text
Competency Score = (Sum of all scores √ó competency weight) / number of scores / total category competency weights
```

#### 2. **Category-Level Aggregation**

For each category:

```text
Category Score = Sum of all competency scores in category
Weighted Category Score = Category Score √ó category weight
```

#### 3. **Final Score Calculation**

```text
Final Score = Sum of all weighted category scores / Sum of all category weights
```

### Key Features

- **Weight-Based**: Both competency and category weights influence the final score
- **Proportional**: Only categories and competencies with actual scores contribute to the calculation
- **Flexible**: Handles partial assessments (not all competencies need scores)
- **Normalized**: Final score is normalized by the total weights of assessed categories

## üéØ Best Practices

### Template Design

- **Clear Descriptions**: Write specific, measurable descriptions for each score level
- **Balanced Weights**: Distribute weights logically across categories and competencies
- **Consistent Granularity**: Keep similar levels of detail across all competencies

### Competency Mapping

- **Strategic Mapping**: Only map competencies where cross-evaluation adds value
- **Documentation**: Keep notes on your mapping rationale for future reference
- **Validation**: Test your mapping strategy with a small group before full deployment

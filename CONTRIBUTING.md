# Contributing to PROMPT 2.0

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PROMPT! It's people like you who make PROMPT such a great tool for project-based teaching.

## 🌟 Our Core Philosophy: The 3 Golden Rules

If you remember nothing else from this guide, please keep these three rules in mind:

1.  **🧹 Leave It Cleaner Than You Found It**: Every time you touch a piece of code, try to leave it in a better state. Tidy up as you go!
2.  **🔍 Do It Right the First Time**: Aim for quality from the start. "Fixing it later" rarely happens, so let's avoid technical debt today.
3.  **🤓 Take Pride in Your Work**: Write code that is a joy to read. Attention to detail is what differentiates good software from great software.
